The vast majority of activities are carried out online in the twenty-first century. Web Applications like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram are becoming more and more popular as a means of communication. When a person is being bullied online it has a lot of adverse effect on the individual including low self-esteem, depression and even suicide. Therefore, in order to reduce the occurrence, a system to detect cyberbullying was implemented using machine learning algorithms namely random forest, Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes and Support Vector Machine using data collected from Twitter, Naïve Bayes was found to perform the best with 85.69% accuracy and 78.26% precision and was integrated into a web application using Flask which takes in texts and predict the class of the bullying accordingly.
